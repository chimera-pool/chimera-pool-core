# Chimera Pool Development Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Universal Platform First
- **Multi-Cryptocurrency Support**: Every feature must consider support for multiple cryptocurrencies
- **Algorithm Agnosticism**: All components must support hot-swappable algorithms
- **Scalability**: Design for 10,000+ concurrent miners per pool
- **Future-Proofing**: Architecture must accommodate new cryptocurrencies and algorithms

### 2. Enterprise-Grade Quality
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms response times for all operations
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime guarantee with graceful degradation
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security with comprehensive audit logging
- **Testing**: 90%+ test coverage with TDD methodology

### 3. User Experience Excellence
- **One-Click Everything**: Installation, deployment, and miner onboarding
- **Zero Configuration**: Automatic optimization and intelligent defaults
- **Cyber-Minimal Design**: Professional, modern interface with consistent theming
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear guides for all user types

### 4. Technical Excellence Standards

#### Code Quality
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Interface Segregation**: Components depend only on interfaces they use
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling through lightweight event system
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with recovery strategies

#### Performance Requirements
- **Concurrent Miners**: Support 10,000+ concurrent connections per pool
- **Response Times**: <100ms for share processing, <50ms for API calls
- **Throughput**: Process 1000+ shares per second
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient memory management with automatic cleanup

#### Security Standards
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for all sensitive operations
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant events

## Non-Negotiables

### What We Will Never Compromise On
1. **Security**: No shortcuts on security, ever
2. **Performance**: Must maintain enterprise-grade performance
3. **Universal Support**: Must support multiple cryptocurrencies
4. **User Experience**: Must be easy to use for all skill levels
5. **Code Quality**: Must maintain high code quality standards
6. **Test Coverage**: Must maintain 90%+ test coverage
7. **Documentation**: Must have comprehensive documentation
