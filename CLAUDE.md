# Claude AI Assistant Context

## Project Overview

This is the **Chimera Pool Universal Mining Pool Platform** - a next-generation, universal mining pool platform that supports multiple cryptocurrencies through its revolutionary hot-swappable algorithm engine.

## Current Development Status

### Completed Components
- ✅ Comprehensive requirements analysis (40+ detailed requirements)
- ✅ System architecture design with cyber-minimal theme
- ✅ Database schema and migrations
- ✅ Basic project structure with Go, Rust, and React components
- ✅ Docker deployment configuration
- ✅ Testing framework setup

### Key Features Implemented
- Hot-swappable algorithm engine (Rust)
- Multi-cryptocurrency support (Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic, BlockDAG, Litecoin, etc.)
- Stratum v1 protocol implementation
- Web dashboard with cyber-minimal design
- Comprehensive testing suite with TDD approach
- One-click installation system
- Enterprise-grade security features

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go (pool management, Stratum server, APIs)
- **Algorithm Engine**: Rust (high-performance cryptographic operations)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (cyber-minimal themed dashboard)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (caching), InfluxDB (time-series)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, NGINX, Prometheus + Grafana

## Current Development Phase

We are implementing **Spec-Driven Development** using GitHub's Spec Kit methodology to complete the remaining development work and achieve full production readiness.

### Immediate Goals
1. Complete the functional specification based on existing requirements
2. Generate detailed implementation plan with task breakdown
3. Execute implementation using TDD principles
4. Achieve production-ready mining pool platform

## Key Differentiators

### Universal Platform Approach
- **100x larger addressable market** than single-coin solutions
- **Multiple revenue streams** from different cryptocurrencies
- **Competitive moat** through technical innovation
- **Future-proof architecture** ready for any new cryptocurrency

### Technical Excellence
- Hot-swappable algorithms with zero downtime
- Enterprise performance (10,000+ concurrent miners)
- Comprehensive security framework
- One-click deployment and setup
- Cyber-minimal design aesthetic

## Development Context

This project represents the "AWS of Mining Pools" - a universal platform that can support any proof-of-work cryptocurrency with enterprise-grade performance, security, and ease of use.

The development follows strict quality standards:
- 90%+ test coverage requirement
- TDD methodology throughout
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Event-driven architecture
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Next Steps

Using the GitHub Spec Kit methodology, we will:
1. Create comprehensive functional specification
2. Generate detailed implementation plan
3. Execute development with continuous validation
4. Deploy production-ready universal mining pool platform
